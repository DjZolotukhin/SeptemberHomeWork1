        Darth Vader is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise. The character is the primary antagonist in the
        original trilogy and, as Anakin Skywalker, is a primary protagonist in the prequel trilogy. Star Wars creator
        George Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth
        Vader".[3]

    Originally a slave on Tatooine, Anakin Skywalker is a Jedi prophesied to bring balance to the Force. He is lured
    to the dark side of the Force by Palpatine and becomes a Sith Lord, assuming the title Darth Vader. After a
    lightsaber battle with his former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar, in which he is severely injured, Vader is
    transformed into a cyborg. He then serves the Galactic Empire as its chief enforcer. Vader ultimately redeems
    himself by saving his son, Luke Skywalker, and killing Palpatine, sacrificing his own life in the process.[4] He
    is also the secret husband of Padm√© Amidala, biological father of Princess Leia, and maternal grandfather of
    Kylo Ren.
